The logo of the Lasco Institute is inspired by the center arch and window of Austin Friars, the building where Lasco's Dutch "Strangers' Church" met in London during the reign of Edward VI.
The seven panes of the window represent the seven liberal arts of classical education.
The blue color represents the waters of the Finger Lakes.
The gray represents the area's nickname: the "Burned Over District".
The magenta is the color of the pioneer species fireweed, one of the first plants to grow after a wildfire. This plant is also called "bombweed" due to its proliferation in London following the bombings of WWII, which destroyed many buildings including the historic location of the Strangers' Church.
